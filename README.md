Why I wanted to do this is because I really like animals.I think that we should start respecting animals and our earth because we only have one of them not many and all the animals have a part in the food chain.Take mesquito they onlly want to repordoce there species think if you were a mesquito you would try not to get squished by a human and the would try to repordoce there species.And do not forget that you are port of Mother Nature.This site should teache you adout 7 endangered species.
